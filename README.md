# HREmployeeAttrition_sqlproject
In this SQL project, I have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the HREmployeeAttrition dataset to enhance my SQL proficiency and gain practical experience in data manipulation and analysis. This dataset provides detailed information about employees, including attributes such as job role, education, and attrition status. The project focuses on executing a series of SQL queries to explore various facets of the data, derive meaningful insights, and uncover trends related to employee attrition.
The primary objectives of this project include:
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I have conducted preliminary investigations to understand the structure and content of the dataset. This involves identifying the number of records, and detecting any inconsistencies or anomalies.
2.	Descriptive Statistics: I have used SQL queries to compute essential statistics, such as averages, minimums, and maximums, to summarize data distributions and understand key metrics like average monthly income and attrition rates across different departments and job roles.
3.	Trend Analysis: The project involves examining trends and patterns in employee attrition based on factors such as job satisfaction, distance from home, and education level. 
4.	Advanced Queries: To deepen my SQL skills, I have implemented advanced queries using aggregation, grouping, conditional logic and window functions to analyze employee turnover by various attributes.
To summarize, this project serves as a valuable exercise in applying SQL techniques to real-world data scenarios, aiming to enhance my ability to draw actionable insights from complex datasets.
